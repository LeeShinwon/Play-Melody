## ❓ FAQ

**Q1. Does the app record or upload video?**  
A. No. Camera frames are processed on-device and never stored or uploaded.

A. Use good lighting, keep hands in view, maintain a steady 30–60 cm distance, and avoid strong backlight.

**Q3. I denied Camera permission by mistake.**  
A. Go to *Settings → Play Melody → Camera* and enable it, then restart the app.
